# Experiment 3: DML Commands

## AIM
To study and implement DML (Data Manipulation Language) commands.

## THEORY

### 1. INSERT INTO
Used to add records into a relation.
These are three type of INSERT INTO queries which are as
A)Inserting a single record
**Syntax (Single Row):**
```sql
INSERT INTO table_name (field_1, field_2, ...) VALUES (value_1, value_2, ...);
```
**Syntax (Multiple Rows):**
```sql
INSERT INTO table_name (field_1, field_2, ...) VALUES
(value_1, value_2, ...),
(value_3, value_4, ...);
```
**Syntax (Insert from another table):**
```sql
INSERT INTO table_name SELECT * FROM other_table WHERE condition;
```
### 2. UPDATE
Used to modify records in a relation.
Syntax:
```sql
UPDATE table_name SET column1 = value1, column2 = value2 WHERE condition;
```
### 3. DELETE
Used to delete records from a relation.
**Syntax (All rows):**
```sql
DELETE FROM table_name;
```
**Syntax (Specific condition):**
```sql
DELETE FROM table_name WHERE condition;
```
### 4. SELECT
Used to retrieve records from a table.
**Syntax:**
```sql
SELECT column1, column2 FROM table_name WHERE condition;
```
**Question 1**
--
Write a SQL statement to double the availability of the product with product_id 1.

products table

---------------
product_id
product_name
category_id
availability

```sql
update products set availability=availability*2 where product_id=1;
```

**Output:**

**Question 8**
---
write a SQL query to create a union of two queries that shows the customer id, cities, and ratings of all customers. Those with a rating of 300 or greater will have the words 'High Rating', while the others will have the words 'Low Rating'.

customer table

cid           name          type   notnull       dflt_value  pk
------------  ------------  -----  ------------  ----------  ----------
0             customer_id   int    0                         0
1             cust_name     text   0                         0
2             city          text   0                         0
3             grade         int    0                         0
4             salesman_id   int    0                         0

```sql
select customer_id,city,grade,"High Rating" as Rating from customer
where grade >= 300

union

select customer_id,city,grade,"Low Rating" as Rating from customer
where grade < 300;
```

**Output:**

**Question 9**
---

                                                                Inventory.db

```sql
select name,city from salesman where city in ('London','Rome') ;
```

**Output:**

<img width="711" height="664" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c23597fb-f77f-4609-b958-c61d0f0622a9" />


**Question 10**
---
write a SQL query to find customers who are either from the city 'New York' or who do not have a grade greater than 100. Return customer_id, cust_name, city, grade, and salesman_id.

Sample table: customer

 customer_id |   cust_name    |    city    | grade | salesman_id 
-------------+----------------+------------+-------+-------------
        3002 | Nick Rimando   | New York   |   100 |        5001
        3007 | Brad Davis     | New York   |   200 |        5001
        3005 | Graham Zusi    | California |   200 |        5002
